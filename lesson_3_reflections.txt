Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. Is, let's say, I was asked to update the file, laying on the beach....

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. I want to be the master of my commits. To make the copies reasonable and to minimize the mess.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. Forks - you make a remote copy of remote one's repository, so you show who's the original author. Clones - you make a local copy of remote/local repository to make updates. Branch - you make a crossroad to try new things before apply them to the master
