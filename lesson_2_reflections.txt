Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. The folder .git was created and now I am ready to commit there my files and support the proper repository

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. We can add files to the staging area one by one to take a track of current "one logical change per file - one staging". Then go to the next file, which is required to be updated for that global "one logical change"

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A. I can add several pages to the staging area before to do one commit for all the single logical commit.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A. I can save in branches some ideas which cannot be implemented in their time but may be realized later.
