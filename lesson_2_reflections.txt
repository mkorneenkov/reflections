Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. The folder .git was created and now I am ready to commit there my files and support the proper repository

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. We can add files to the staging area one by one to take a track of current "one logical change per file - one staging". Then go to the next file, which is required to be updated for that global "one logical change"
